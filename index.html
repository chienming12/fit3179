                <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">The <b style="font-family:sans-serif;">Total Cases of Car Accidents in the United States from 2016 to 2021</b> is shown on the left, where the cases of Car Accidents grow each year. This is due to the advancement of our current technology
                    bounded world as more and more cars are being produced, hence more and more cars are purchased by users which causes a rise in car accidents as well. However, this causes them to be less careful and mindful while driving as cars get
                    cheaper. </p>
                <span></span>
                <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">With that said, 2021 has a huge jump in car accidents as more people are eager to get out of their houses due to Covid-19 lockdowns. The only place that does not involve crowds would be the personal space in your own car. The mental state
                    of the general public has went downhill due to the lockdown which might be a reason to the sudden skyrocket of car accidents in 2021.</p>

                <p>The chart on the right shows the <b>Top 3 States of the United States with the Highest Car Accidents Cases</b>, which are <b style="color:red">California</b>, <b style="color: blue;">Texas</b>, and <b style="color:orange">Florida</b>.
                    These 3 states are relatively larger in size and are more developed states in the United States. Thus, more citizens have access to cars which leads to more car accidents as well.</p>

        <div id="txt1" style="text-align: center;">
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">From the map above, we can see that <b style="color:red">California</b>, <b style="color: blue;">Texas</b>, and <b style="color:orange">Florida</b> all have relatively high humidity. This shows that places with higher humidity are more prone
                to car accidents as humid weather would cause more slipper roads.</p>
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">Although the highest humidity states are not shown in the top 3 states, it is due to the size of the state. <b style="color:red">California</b>, <b style="color: blue;">Texas</b>, and <b style="color:orange">Florida</b> are considered larger
                states and when compared to other similar sizes states, the number of cases of these 3 states are much higher, which humidity holds a part of the reason for this.</p>

        <div id="txt1" style="text-align: center;">
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">The chart above shows how weather affect the number of cases of accidents. In this case, we can see that on a <b style="color: red" ; ">Fair</b> weather, most drivers are not mindful as driving becomes a muscle memory movement, and fair weather makes the environment feel safe. Thus, people tend to be more confident in speeding or driving without much focus. Obviously, this is also due  to people travelling more on a fair weather.</p>
            <p style="font-family:sans-serif; ">On the other hand, <b style="color: orange ";">Rain</b> weather causes most drivers are to be more careful as they know that there is a risk of accidents happening, hence they drive safer and slower. Once
                again, the reduce of accidents is also caused by people travelling lesser on a rain weather.</p>

                <div class="space"></div>
                <p>The chart on the left shows that most accidents are not very severe, with a measurement of 1 to 4, most accidents occur on <b style="color:red">Severity 2</b>, which is not so severe. This is because we can see from the previous chart
                    that most accidents happen on a fair day, thus drivers that encounter accidents can usually lessen the severity as the roads are rougher and easier to brake, causing less damage to the accidents.</p>

                <div class="space"></div>
                <p>The chart on the right shows the Severity against the Distance of Car Accidents, which proves the previously mentioned point where <b style="color:orange">Severity 2</b> has the most cases which is proven by the distance of the car accidents.
                    The amount of cases in <b style="color:orange">Severity 2</b> mostly only has a <b style="color:orange">Distance < 50 meters</b>. This means that most accidents happen dont travel far, which is why it is less severe. Although there
                    are far distances in Severity 2 as well, this proves that even if the distance of the accident is huge, it is not so sever due to the fair weather, where drivers can have better control of their car. </p>

            <p style="font-family:sans-serif; ">With this, we can see all the how these variables affect car accidents in each state. From the chart, we can tell that the rise and fall of each variable changes the number of cases overall.</p>
